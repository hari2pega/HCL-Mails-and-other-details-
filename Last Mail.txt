
Hi All, 

As I don't see reply on my Email, Last friday (match 5th) I put a request in the Exit management system. 

I believe this morning Raj had approved and I believe next step would be HR.

As there is no response on my release date and due to my father ill conditions I don't have any further intrest to work thus I have submitted my Laptop & HCl ID card at HCL Hyderabad office.

Please be informed that I will be checking my emails and I will be answering all your questions if you have anything.

I am no more intrested to work with Raj & Team. This morning I have submitted my Laptop & HCLID Card in hyderabad Office to .....

-- Thanks to all of you.

Regards, 
Harish
